      info: "Samy Kamkar, cofounder of Openpath Security, is a security researcher and author of the MySpace worm, the fastest spreading virus of all time. His open source research highlights the insecurities and privacy implications in everyday technologies from the Evercookie which produces virtually immutable respawning cookies, to SkyJack, a drone that wirelessly hijacks and autonomously controls other drones. Other projects include GlitchSink to non-invasively glitch secure microcontrollers for firmware and secret extraction, a 3D printed Arduino-based combination lock cracker, RollJam to wirelessly unlock and start cars (without their keys), OpenSesame turning a child's toy into a garage hacking device, and producing edible iridescent chocolate. His work has been cited by the NSA, triggered hearings on Capitol Hill, and has been the basis for security advancements across devices from the one in your pocket to the many surveilling you from the sky.",

She was an Assistant Professor at the University of Virginia, and she obtained her Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University in 2017. Her research interests involve security and privacy and their interactions with computer systems, machine learning, and human-computer interaction. Her current research focuses on developing new computing platforms with strong security and privacy features, particularly in the Internet of Things and machine learning. Her work has real-world impacts as countermeasures and design changes have been integrated into platforms (such as Android, Chrome, Azure, and iOS) and also impacted the security recommendations of standard organizations such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). She is a recipient of the Okawa Fundation Award 2022, Google Research Scholar Award 2021, Facebook Research Award 2021, NSF CAREER award 2020, NSF CRII award 2019, Amazon AI Faculty Fellowship 2019. Her research has appeared in top-tier venues in security, machine learning, and systems. Her projects have been covered by media outlets such as IEEE Spectrum, Forbes, Fortune, Wired, and Telegraph.",
