      title: "Software Engineer, Verkada",
      info: "Raphael Ruban graduated from Stanford in 2024 with a BS and MS in Computer Science. He will be speaking on agentic AI and threat detection: Developing threat detections is slow, repetitive work. Learn how we cut threat detection development and maintenance time by over 80%. We'll explore our 'detection duet': a custom agentic workflow for writing new rules from unstructured ideas, and a general-purpose agent for code maintenance.",
